Legend has it that chess was invented in India more than 
of 1500 years. The King was so fascinated by such an invention 
and its infinite possible games that made it possible to present 
the inventor of such a magnificent thing. Then said the King: How 
Shall I reward you for such a magnificent creation? The Inventor 
humbly said to him: Your Majesty I wish only a grain of 
rice for the first house two grains for the second 4 for the 
third and so on until the last house 64th. The King was 
surprised by such a request but decided to present it anyway. 
Mathematicians of the kingdom did the calculation of how many 
grains of rice they were and promptly persuaded the King not to 
give him such gift.
